Hi, welcome to my NOX/MEmu thread. Ive made these scripts for NOX and MEmu based off my [AutoTouch/AnkuLua TM Farming Macros for Android Smartphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/5z2sql/tm_farming_macros_for_android_smartphones/). These have been tested extensively, are safe, extremely fast (35sec per run on a mid-level PC) and stable. Ive also added a few customizable features such as setting your run numbers and wait time between runs on the no-refill script. Ive included several resolutions. The 480x854 version is quite fast and runs well on low-end PCs and laptops. The 800x1280 version uses a slightly different screen layout, and I find it more macro friendly (its also a bit wider!) but any of the versions work great, so really it is just a matter of preference. If you find that the click speed is too fast in the normal version, try the "Slow Click" version instead. I have now included a version that will work with the same default settings (1280x720) for people not wanting to change resolutions. For any of my other scripts to work properly you will have to change your screen orientation to portrait mode by changing your resolution settings to custom. All my TM farming macros are 100% compatible with JP (extra screens) and should be future-proof in GL for many months to come. If you have any questions or need help with setup, PM me or leave a comment below

>[Disclaimer](/#label-red) I am not responsible for any loss regarding user-error or improper use of the content of this page. I can however guarantee, that with proper setup and execution, my TM farming builds are 100% safe. My builds will never mis-use lapis in any content with mobs stronger then ES-Entrance. 

I can guarantee my TM farming macros will not waste lapis on the wrong content. Heres a test of me trying to run it through vortex, notice how will only ever use 3 units to attack, causing it to pause whenever faced with mobs stronger then those of earthshrine. You will never lose a single lapis to vortex or story dungeons.

>**IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS PLEASE CHECK YOUR RESOLUTION SETTINGS AND/OR UPDATE TO THE NEWEST MEMU VERSION (2.9.6.1) at www.memuplay.com**

 [WARNING](/#label-red) **DO NOT USE ACCELERATION, SET AT 1X ONLY** _*unless otherwise specified_

[TIPS](/#label-blue) 

  - If you want to run your NRG down to ZERO as fast as possible but not do a refill, you can use acceleration with the "No-Refill" version for faster runs, but the run counter feature will not work. 
  - I recommend using a custom launcher (Nova Launcher) instead of the stock Launcher. Nova Launcher allows for a completely custom [HOME SCREEN](http://i.imgur.com/UuatlJ9.png)
  - If the click speed in the "TM Refills" version is too fast and causes lag , Try the "SLOW CLICK" version instead
  - Want to [shrink your screen down](http://i.imgur.com/ZV0qUuq.png) even more?? [WATCH THIS](https://vid.me/1LVg#label-yellow)

  - I recommend using a custom launcher (Nova Launcher) instead of the stock NOX Launcher. Nox Launcher installs random icons on your homescreen. [**PICTURE**](http://i.imgur.com/UuatlJ9.png)

#Optimal Icon Placement for Crash Scenarios#

Stock Memu Launcher

  - **480 version** - http://i.imgur.com/jLYeLy0.png

  - **720 version** - http://imgur.com/a/mndGY

  - [Do not use 800 version with stock MeMu launcher](/tg)

Nova Launcher

  - **720 version** - http://i.imgur.com/pFdpexa.png

  - **800 version** - http://i.imgur.com/DYxlPbK.png

Download and use "Nova Launcher" for sub-grid positioning if your having trouble with your app placement. In Nova Settings hit "DESKTOP" then "DESKTOP GRID" and check "SUBGRID POSITIONING". You can also increase your grid size and icon size for further customization. Make sure you set Nova Launcher to your default "HOME" to prevent switching back to "Stock" MEmu launcher

#TROUBLESHOOTING#

>MEMU INSTALLATION AND SCRIPT COPY VIDEO IF YOUR HAVING ISSUES --> [**VIDEO LINK**](https://vid.me/8bPH#label-yellow)

  - If the click speed is too fast in TM Refills, Use the "SLOW CLICK" version instead, you can use acceleration in the slow click version to select your desired speed
  - Check you copy/pasted your script properly, either chose the "RAW" option on the pastebin website or "DOWNLOAD" and copy/paste it. Make sure you start with a blank script.
  - If the script appears to do nothing after you press "play", change your resolution to "CUSTOM" and use the settings in the pictures above. If your homescreen is in Landscape Mode, it wont work, you have to change it too portrait mode using the custom resolution settings.
  - Make sure you have "ACCELERATION" set to 1x, unless otherwise specified
  - If your experiencing black bars at the top and bottom in 720x1280 go into "Interface Options" and make sure "Remember Size and Position" is ON. These black bars are normal in the 480x854 version
  - If you are being interrupted by screensavers (DayDreams), Turn "DayDream" Settings "OFF"
  - If your experiencing issues with crashing, Update to the newest version of your emulator (NOX 3.8.1.1/MEmu 2.9.6.1) also "Re-Download Data" from the Title Page in the FFBE app and/or clear cache (From Homescreen, go to Settings/Storage/Cached Data/Clear Cache)
  - If your having issues with performance, it is highly recommended to enable "VIRTUALIZATION" within your PC's BIOS Settings
  - If your NOX version is below 2.7.2.0, please update it will not be compatible
  - If it is not operating properly (eg. Hitting Repeat, Hitting your companion unit, Missing Buttons) stop using it and PM me immediately
  - If your having crashing/performance issues, try the 480x854 Version, it uses much less resources because it runs at a lower screen resolution (its faster too!)
